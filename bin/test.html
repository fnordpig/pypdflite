<h1>My Week</h1>
<p>Today, the day is <span class="red coolfont" data-bind="daytoday"></span>, and it is sunny here in
    <span class="green" data-bind="location"></span>. Honestly, it's almost always sunny. It
    can get rather boring.</p>

<ol type='I' ">
<li>Fall Carnivals</li>
<li>Skiing <span class='blue' data-bind="skiing"></span></li>
<li>Museums</li>
<li><p>And a whole bunch of other things, that I'm not sure if I just liked it because I was a kid,
or because it was actually a lot of fun.</p></li>
<li>Testing Second List</li>
